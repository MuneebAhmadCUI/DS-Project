# 🐛 Final Bugs Fixed Report

| Bug Description | Fix Applied | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Crash on Space:** Entering names like "Ali Khan" skipped the next input. | Replaced `cin` with `getline(cin, name)`. | ✅ Fixed |
| **Infinite Loop:** Entering a letter 'a' instead of a number caused an infinite loop. | Added `cin.clear()` and input validation check. | ✅ Fixed |
| **Memory Leak:** Deleted nodes were not freed from memory. | Added `delete temp` inside the cancellation logic. | ✅ Fixed |
| **Messy Code:** All logic was inside `main()`. | Moved logic to functions (`addPassenger`, `createNode`). | ✅ Fixed |
