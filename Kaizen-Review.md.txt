# Kaizen Improvement Review - RailVerse

| What was built | Problem/Limitation Found | Improvement Idea | Responsible | Expected Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linear Search** | Searching takes O(n) time. If we have 1 million passengers, it's slow. | Implement a **Hash Table** or **BST** for O(1) or O(log n) search. | Moosa | Instant search results regardless of list size. |
| **Linked List** | Data is lost when the program closes (RAM only). | Add **File Handling** to save data to `.txt` or `.csv`. | Muneeb | Data persistence; records stay after restart. |
| **Console UI** | The text is plain and hard to read. | Add **ANSI colors** or a simple **GUI**. | Faisal | Better user experience and readability. |
| **Single Deletion**| Can only delete by ID one by one. | Add "Delete All" or "Delete by Name" feature. | Iman | Faster management for admin users. |
